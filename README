bitfield-gmp
============

Version 0.0.1 (May, 2017)

bitfield-gmp is a library of functions for converting between bit fields (or bit
arrays) from bitfield package and real numbers from GMP.

Installation
------------

To compile bitfield from source code:

$ autoconf
$ ./configure --prefix=DIRECTORY
$ make

This will build both a static and a shared version. To build just one of them,
replace "make" with "make static" or "make shared".

To test the compiled library:

$ make test

To build and run some example applications:

$ make example

The generic way to install the compiled files is:

$ make install
$ ldconfig

However, one might prefer to use distro-specific installation mechanism (like
"checkinstall") instead.

Usage
-----

Using the functions provided by bitfield-gmp library in a project is
straightforward. If bitfield-gmp library files are installed system-wide in
standard locations, then one needs to (1) include a system version of the header
file to the source

#include <bitfield-gmp.h>

and (2) add the "-lbitfield-gmp" flag to compiler instructions

gcc ... -lbitfield

Alternatively, if bitfield-gmp library is integrated into a project, then one
needs to (1) include a local version of the header file to the source

#include "PATH_TO_HEADER/bitfield-gmp.h"

and (2) add the "-lbitfield" flag, along with the path to the header and path 
to the library to compiler instructions

gcc ... -I$(PATH_TO_HEADER) -L$(PATH_TO_LIBRARY) -lbitfield-gmp

Comment: since the bindings are only needed when using both bitfield and gmp
functions, the "-lbitfield-gmp" key will most probably need to be accompanied by
"-lgmp" and "-lbitfield" keys.

Functions
---------

bitfield_to_mpz copies a bit array into a multiple precision integer

mpz_to_bitfield copies a multiple precision integer into a bit array
